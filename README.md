This module consists of two challenges. Both due on Monday, October 31.

**# Description**

This repo contains the required files for the PyBank and PyPoll Python Challenges for Vincent Passanisi

**# Files**

**PyBank** This folder contains the PyBank Challenge

   ** **Included Files****

        **Main.py* is my python script for the challenge

        *Resources folder with budget_data.csv

        *analysis folder with finance_result.txt which contains the output of my python script.

**PyPoll** This folder contains the PyPoll Challenge

    ****Included Files****

        **Main.py* is my python script for the PyPoll challenge.

        **Main_version2.py* is a second attempt at solving the same challenge using a nested dictionary instead of lists.

        *Resources folder with election_data.csv

        *analysis folder with poll_result.txt and poll_result_v2.txt which contain the output of my python scripts.

**Instructions** This folder contains the original files provided for the challenge

**# Results**

I believe I sucessfully completed the challenge. Both files create the required output and print that output to a text file in the analysis folder. The second version of my PyPoll script also works, but in a different way.

**# Comments and Thoughts**

Once again, I attempted this challenge well before we had covered all the material in class, which resulted in a lot of frustration at the beginning. I wanted to give myself plenty of time to complete the work. I worked through a few issues with the help of AskBSC and my tutor. My tutor was a great help in getting me to understand the logic needed for my conditionals and looping for the PyBank challenge. Using what I learned, I was able to complete the PyPoll challenge with little help.

I had more difficulty with the PyPoll challenge, and I wasn't completely satisfied with the result. I wanted my script to run regardless of how the data was ordered in the .csv file. Instead, I had to break it up into a couple parts in order to get the results I wanted. The completed script gets the job done, but not in the way that I had hoped. I decided to continue to work on a second version. I was much happier with the result although it is a longer script. I was able to get all the information I wanted into a nested dictionary. Much of my difficulty arose in trying to access all the information in my dictionary in order to get the needed output. With the help of my tutor, we put together a nested loop and assigned all the key values to variables that could then be used to generate the output file. I also had to use a list comprehension to assign the vote percentages to a new list.

I tried to incorporate the feedback I received on Module 2 by including more comments in my script exlplaining what I was doing and what the variables were for. I enjoyed working on this challenge very much, and I learned a great deal.
