I believe I sucessfully completed the challenge and bonus. My subroutine runs on every worksheet tabs just by running the script once.

**# Comments and Thoughts**

I attempted this challenge before we had covered the material in class, and I actually made a lot of progres, though I confess I was super frustrated and banging my head against the wall at a few points. :-D

Curiously, I came up with a few solutions on my own that turned out to be close to correct, just by thinking logically. I did use a few resources that I found online and I noted those in my script. I need to find out what the best practice is for giving credit to others where it is due.

I confess, after covering the material in class, this exercise was far easier, but I'm glad I tackled it in advance, because the material in class looked familiar and I was able to see where I could use certain functions right away.
