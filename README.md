**# Comments and Thoughts**

Once again, I attempted this challenge well before we had covered all the material in class, which resulted in a lot of frustration at the beginning. I wanted to give myself plenty of time to complete the work. I worked through a few issues with the help of AskBSC and my tutor. My tutor was a great help in getting me to understand the logic needed for my conditionals and looping for the PyBank challenge. Using what I learned, I was able to complete the PyPoll challenge with little help.

I had more difficulty with the PyPoll challenge, and I'm satill not completely satisfied with the result. I wanted my script to run regrdless of how the data was ordered in the .csv file. Instead, I had to break it up into a couple parts in order to get the results I wanted. The completed script gets the job done, but not in the way that I had hoped.

I tried to incorporate the feedback I received on Module 2 by including more comments in my script exlplaining what I was doing and what the variables were for.
